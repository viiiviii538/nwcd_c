# nwcd_c

This Flutter project contains only a minimal home screen. Tapping **リアルタイム** shows a short progress indicator.

The **フルスキャン** button displays a simulated report of open ports for devices on the local network. The report lists each monitored port, its associated risk and the devices that expose the port.

For general Flutter setup instructions, see the [online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/).
