This Flutter project contains a minimal home screen. Tapping **リアルタイム** shows a short progress indicator. Tapping **フルスキャン** performs a simulated device scan and displays a table of devices that require updates or expose known vulnerabilities.

For general Flutter setup instructions, see the [online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/).
