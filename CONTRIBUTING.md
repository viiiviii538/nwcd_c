## Setup

1. Install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/) **3.29.2**, which ships with Dart **3.7.2**.
   Use `flutter --version` to verify the installed versions.
2. Clone this repository and fetch dependencies:

   ```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Whenever you change **pubspec.yaml**, run `flutter pub get` again so all
   packages are up to date.

## Running tests

Execute the test suite from the project root with:

```bash
flutter test
```

This command uses Flutter's built-in test runner.
